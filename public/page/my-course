**Build real-world software using TDD — and level up your development workflow with AI.**

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is one of the most powerful practices in software engineering. But for many developers, it remains stuck in toy examples like Tic-Tac-Toe or FizzBuzz — far removed from the messy realities of production systems.

This course was created to bridge that gap.

Whether you're a junior trying to get TDD right from the start, or a senior developer looking to take a more structured, maintainable approach to building software, this course will help you apply TDD confidently in real-world codebases.

### What you’ll learn:

- Develop real-world applications from scratch using Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Design and test RESTful APIs using Outside-In TDD techniques
- Use AI tools to boost productivity — while keeping full control of your process
- Write maintainable, fast, deterministic, and isolated unit tests
- Understand and apply core TDD principles in a practical and accessible way

---

I created this course to distill over **12 years of professional experience** into a practical and focused learning path — one that I wish existed when I was first learning TDD.

If you're ready to stop just *reading* about TDD and start *using* it effectively in real-world projects, this course is for you.
