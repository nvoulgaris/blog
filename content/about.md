Professional software engineer and scrum master, passionate about clean code and software craftsmanship. I strongly believe in the power of the community worldwide and therefore, I love to share my knowledge and broaden my horizons. I am particularly interested in software design and Extreme Programming practices and I am really fascinated by Outside-In Test Driven Development.

I am currently employed at [Vivante Health](https://vivantehealth.com/), contributing as a software engineer in a scrum team. In the past, I have been employed by organizations ranging from [Nokia](https://www.nokia.com/) and [Tripsta](http://www.tripsta.com/) to small Greek companies, having the opportunity to work from worldwide projects to small websites and mobile applications.

During the day, I write software. During the night, I present in radio, DJ, study Italian, travel, read lots of books, (used to) play basketball and I would do more if only I could extend the 24 hours...
