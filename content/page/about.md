I'm a professional software engineer with over 12 years of industry experience. I'm passionate about clean code, software craftsmanship, and building systems that are both elegant and maintainable. I firmly believe in the power of global developer communities, which is why I enjoy sharing knowledge and continuously learning from others.

Throughout my career, I've held various roles — including Staff Software Engineer and Engineering Manager — at companies of all sizes. From global organizations like [Nokia](https://www.nokia.com), to tech-driven scale-ups like [Blueground](https://www.theblueground.com), and fast-moving startups, I've had the chance to work across a wide range of software projects and business domains, including telecommunications (4G networks), travel, healthcare, and real estate.

Outside of software development, I enjoy traveling and experiencing different cultures, reading (not just technical books), exploring the world of wine, and — more recently — diving into photography.
