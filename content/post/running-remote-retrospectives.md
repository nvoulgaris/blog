Remote work has become an integral part of a number of professions, with software engineering being number one in the list. Working remotely requires a steady cultural foundation and a shift of mind on how some things are treated. I believe that there is quite a lot of room for improvement on these points.

So, in this article I will share my thoughts and tips on points I consider important when running a remote retrospective. These come from the point of view of a scrum master. It doesn't matter if one calls herself a scrum master or not. From the moment one decides to drive a retrospective, one wears the hat, at least temporarily.

My intention here is not to cover the fundamentals, such as the goal and the structure of the session or the action items. These are covered extensively in my [driving fruitful retrospectives](https://nvoulgaris.com/driving-fruitful-retros) post. My aim is to complement that post with the special case of a geographically distributed team.

# Engagement

The primary goal of a scrum master remains the same whether the retrospective is taking place remotely or colocated. It is to make sure that **all participants engage in the activity**. This is a precondition. I cannot imagine a successful session that fails to meet this. When I drive retrospectives, this is the primary reason for which I always use the "set the stage" step.

We will discuss a few extra points on this topic further below, on the "facilitation" part, but the reason that I am mentioning it here is that being remote imposes a few extra difficulties. So, before even starting the session, I would propose to focus on communication.

> Without communication, there is no engagement and without engagement, there is no retrospective.

Therefore I would propose to spend some time both during the preparation of the session and at the beginning of it to make sure that people can be seen, heard and understood.

## Use the camera

Using the camera is a great tip for remotely working teams. I find it particularly important during the retrospective. It feels very different conversing with just a voice than with an individual who is located somewhere else. Context and a great deal of expressivity derives from our body language. A lot of our reactions are expressed via it, using facial expressions or hand gestures, without verbal communication. Take a moment to think of how much volume of information is missed when listening to someone without seeing him.

These, missing pieces of information, are what can make the difference between a constructive argument and one that leads to a dead end. These can also have a resounding effect on team bonding and chemistry in the long run. Personally, I always encourage geographically distributed teams to use their cameras as much as they can, but when it comes to the retrospective, I *insist* that everyone should use it.

## Make sure everyone can be seen and heard

Taking the time to make sure that everything is functioning properly before starting the retrospective is very important. Have everybody say something. Is everyone's mic functioning as expected? Can everyone hear everybody else? Can everyone see everybody else? 

There is no point in starting a retrospective without resolving all sound and image problems. As a matter of fact, in case there is such a problem, the last thing the team wants is to interrupt in the middle of an exercise to resolve a technical issue with somebody's mic or camera. The last thing a participant wants is to contribute to the conversation only to find out, after a few seconds, that no one heard him.

# Tools

Being remote significantly restricts both the options on tools that can be used and the range of exercises that we can run. However, a wise choice on a collaboration tool and a careful selection of exercises can really boost the results of the session.

## Use an online collaboration tool

## Reconsider the format

# Facilitation

As far as facilitation is concerned most of the things that apply in colocated retrospectives, apply to remote ones too. Therefore, I will not repeat the thoughts that I have expressed in [driving fruitful retrospectives](https://nvoulgaris.com/driving-fruitful-retros) (such as how to deal with silent members or members that dominate the conversation), but there are a few points worth discussing.

These thoughts assume that the facilitator is acting as a scrum master. The case the facilitator wears two hats, the one of the scrum master and the one of the member of the development team is outside of the scope of this blog post. As I usually wear these two hats, I believe that driving a retrospective is perhaps the most challenging part of this dual role. Perhaps it is even worth a dedicated blog post.

## Make yourself invisible

As always, try to make the team forget that you are even there. At all times, keep in mind that the scrum master is needed to help the team work meaningfully during the session. Try to *be a servant leader*. When needed, remind the team that you are *not the protagonist*.

For instance, I sometimes find that team members address me when "sticking notes" and want to explain them. This constitutes a mini alarm for me. Usually, when I am physically present, I point to the rest of the team. This gets the job done and does not interrupt the team member. However, when being remote, I have no option but to interrupt her. It is one of the last things I want to do, but having someone addressing me is a signal I take very seriously. The retrospective is being derailed and I should take action.

As a second example, when team members are called to come up with input and "stick it to the wall", they sometimes look for the facilitator to impose an order or the process. Take extra care to be "absent" at that point. This is easier to achieve when being remote. Just stay silent and let them *self-organize*. They will do it. Remember that silence is gold in this case. If it gets uncomfortable, just keep on staying silent. Someone will break the silence and the team will eventually function on its own.

I could go on with a dozen examples, but I believe that the message is clear. Facilitate the session as an act of servant leadership, but fly below the radar as much as possible.

## Focus on equality

## Consider breaking the ice

## Make sure everyone contributes

Every individual has a unique personality. Changes are that in a scrum team the spectrum of these personalities is going to be very broad. Naturally, some team members will open up more easily than others. However, it is crucial for the success of the retrospective to have everyone contributing. Unfortunately, it is easier for a closed person to "hide" and remain a spectator during a remote retrospective than during a colocated one. This is a problem that requires attention and very careful manoeuvring from the scrum master. Remember, that failing to address this can lead to losing a great part of the value of the session.

Initially, make sure than during the "set the stage" step, everyone speaks and seems engaged and comfortable to contribute. Then, I would propose to choose the exercises very carefully. Prefer the ones that work in a round-robin fashion over the ones the require initiative form individuals. For instance, it is more likely to have  everyone contributing in an "I like - I wish" kind of exercise, during which all members are required to speak at their own turn than in a "5-why analysis". During the latter, the same people could be asking and answering the questions throughout the whole exercise. Lastly, if nothing works and you notice that people remain passive, try to stimulate them. Ask them for their opinion on the matter or if they have something else to contribute that is not heard until now.

In any case, this matter requires very delicate moves. Try hard not to be intrusive. A person that feels judgement is being passed to her can feel offended and distance herself even more from the session. At all times, keep in mind that *empathy is a key quality for any scrum master*. Try to get into her shoes and do the best to help her and the team.
