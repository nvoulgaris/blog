How many times have you found yourself engaged in a retrospective, wondering why do you lose all this time? How many times have you committed to action items that no one ever dealt with them in any way? How many times have you caught your team/yourself discussing the same issues again and again thinking that this will not be the last time?

Retrospectives are very hard-to-drive meetings. The hurdles to overcome are countless. Team members that will not open up, team members that dominate the conversation, inability to identify root causes, lack of commitment to action items, frustration, politics, just to name a few. Sometimes the Jocker (Scrum Master) has to display a great arsenal to keep this under control and - above all - meaningful.

Let me endeavour to put lessons learned from my personal experience to paper. Throughout this post I will be referring to sprint retrospectives (called retros for short from now on), but these principles, more or less apply to all kinds of retros (release retros, departmental retros etc).

# The Goal

Before we even begin talking about how to carry out successful retros, let's think for a moment why we have them in the first place. This meeting is a key part of the ever ending *inspect and adapt* loop. It's the team's official slot reserved for thinking what we did during the last sprint and how could we improve it.

Bear in mind that this is the last resort for improvement. The proper moment is *any* moment. As soon as we know that something could be improved, we should try to improve it right away. However, this runs the great risk of never prioritizing and never doing it and therefore, the sprint retro is there to force us to work on these issues.

A successful retro should **always** produce [SMART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria) action items (make sure that you track these). More on this topic further on the post.

# Structure

One of the great pitfalls to be avoided is not preparing a retro before facilitating it. Structure and preparation are **key** to the success of the retro and there is a reason for it. Team members often get emotional or carried away when engaged in retro conversations (they are supposed to after all) and it can be very easy to lose sight of the goal and spend the session in a meaningless way.

Always make sure that you know how the session unfolds relative to the schedule. Is it going too slow? Are we spending too much time on this topic? How far behind are we? Always make sure that there is enough time to reach to action items.

In an ideal situation, a mature team should be able to walk into the retro and just share their thoughts, drive the discussion to conclusions and action items, commit on working on them and move on with the following sprint. However, since this is barely realistic, I always use exercises to put the team in the right context and help them focus on identifying strengths, weaknesses and areas to improve. An excellent source of exercises is [retromat](https://retromat.org). In the vast majority of the retros I have facilitated, I have broken the structure down to the following five sections.

## Set the stage
*Usually 5-10 minutes for a 90 minute retro, depending on the team size*

Take the time to communicate the purpose of the session and the schedule. It may sound redundant, but it will help the team members orient themselves during the retro and focus on the task at hand for the following time period.

Usually I ask for a very brief check-in phrase or input (e.g. describe the previous sprint in 3 words). Simplistic as it may sound, keep in mind that there may be people in the room that are hard to open up. As a Scrum Master, we should always make sure that every team member feel comfortable to speak and is engaged in the team exercise. This is what I focus on during this short phase. **Get everyone onboard for what's about to follow**.

## Gather data
*Usually 20-25 minutes for a 90 minute retro, depending on the team size*

This is the time to identify what went wrong (or could just be improved) and what the team did well (this is also very important).

Use an exercise that focuses on plain facts. Ask for both negative and positive facts. As it is important to amend any problematic areas, it is equally important to preserve the good habits. Preferably, before discussing, allow the team some time to silently think and jot down a few things on sticky notes, in order to avoid affecting each other's thought in this part. If necessary, You may feed the team one or two defective ares that you recognized during the sprint, prior to the exercise, to accelerate results, but be very careful not to guide them.

This is an extremely important step, as it will feed the rest of the retro with data. If the team fails to come up with the right issues here, it is almost inevitable that the real issues will remain untouched, no matter how great the effort in the rest of the session.

## Generate insights
*Usually 20-25 minutes for a 90 minute retro, depending on the team size*

Having identified the major pain points in the previous step, it's time to address them. The point of this step is to come up with potential solutions to these pain points, but *do not neglect preserving the good habits* as well.

Pick an exercise to help the team interpret the data gathered from the previous step and come up with action items to address the problems and stick to the good habits. Usually, I avoid a lot of conversation and interaction up to this point to keep the process of gathering the data impartial, but this is the point to allow collaboration to kick in (e.g. working in pairs or a lot of conversation). Make sure the team members are interacting in a productive way. If the items from the previous step are too many, ask the team to prioritize them and work the list top to bottom until the allocated time (or the list) runs out. Ideally, by the end of this step a list with ideas (solutions to problems, things to start/stop/continue doing etc) is composed and lies visible to all the team (e.g. sticky notes on the wall, whiteboard etc).

Always keep in mind that this is the very heart of the retro. Tension may be caused, strong arguments may take place. This is healthy and desired, but always make sure that the situation is under control and is actually going somewhere. As as Scrum Master, make sure that personal attacks are avoided, only productive arguments are hold and the team deals mainly with what is in its hands.

## Decide what to do
*Usually 20-25 minutes for a 90 minute retro, depending on the team size*

Presumably, most of the hard work is over. A list of action items is in the team's hands. What id left is to decide on a reasonable amount of action items to work on the upcoming sprint.

In this step, I always like using exercises that foster collaboration (and conversation) and create clear, unambiguous results. For instance, an impediments cup (https://retromat.org/en/?id=88), facilitates prioritizing action items, creating a clear result and fosters discussion while doing so.

Basically, this is a matter of prioritization. All action items are useful, but the team has to commit to a reasonable number of them. This depends on a lot of factors (size of the team, difficulty of the action item, sprint length etc). Make sure that the decisions are taken collaboratively (but not chase after consent, as it can kill the retro) and the reasons for them are clear to the team. Additionally, be very careful not to use a process that creates winners and losers, as this can hurt morale.

## Close the retrospective
*Usually 5-10 minutes for a 90 minute retro, depending on the team size*

This step can be used to both get feedback on the retro and close the session in a light tone. It's very likely that as problems surfaced, people opened up, things got tense and there were disagreements. This was very desired indeed, but as the session draws to a close, the point is to leave all these behind, keep all the hard work and close in a good mood in order to begin the next sprint.

Any very brief exercise will do for this part. Just make sure that as you achieve the above mentioned goal, you're not tiring an already exhausted team. Preferably, choose a fun and invigorating exercise.

# SMART action items

# Dealing with silent team members

# Dealing with team members that dominate the conversation

# Conclusion



Keep the team energized and blood flowing. Keep it playful.
